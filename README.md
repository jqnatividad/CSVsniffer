This repository has been conceived to reproduce the experiments described in the paper: 

[**Detecting CSV File Dialects by Table Uniformity Measurement and Data Type Inference**](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0858) 
[(PDF)](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202402.0858/v2/download)

by [W. Garc√≠a](https://sciprofiles.com/profile/3400377).

An application of the methodology described in the paper can be found in the [CSV interface](https://github.com/ws-garcia/VBA-CSV-interface) repository. 

## Introduction

The results from the research can be reproduced by running the `RunTests` method from the macro-enabled Excel workbook `CSVsniffer.xlsm`. To review the results for CleverCSV it is necessary to run the scripts from the `clevercsv_test.py` file. The text files with the results output are stored in the `Current research` and `cleverCSV` folders


## Data

The `CSV` folder contains the files copied from the [Pollock framework](https://github.com/HPI-Information-Systems/Pollock) and other collected test files. The expect configuration for each CSV tested is saved in the `DialectConf.txt` file, new files can be added.

## Requirements

Below are the requirements for reproducing the experiments.

- Microsoft Office Excel.
- [CleverCSV](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/CleverCSV) and all its dependencies.
