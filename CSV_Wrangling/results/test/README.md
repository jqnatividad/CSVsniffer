# Results

The results will be placed here. The structure is as follows:

1. The **preprocessing** directory stores output from automatic ground truth 
   detection (a.k.a. *normal forms*). 

2. The **detection** directory stores the output of the detectors, as well as 
   the ground truth (``out_reference``).

3. The **analysis** directory stores the analysis output in figures, tables, 
   and constants.
